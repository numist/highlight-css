{"name":"highlight-css","tagline":"css files created from pygment's built-in styles","body":"highlight-css\r\n============\r\n\r\n[Pygments](http://pygments.org), a Python-based code highlighting tool, comes with a set of builtin [styles](http://dev.pocoo.org/projects/pygments/browser/pygments/styles) (not css files) for code highlighting. You have to generate a CSS file using the command line. I just figured I'd save someone this work in the future and generate all the CSS files based on the Pygments builtins.\r\n\r\nPretty simple stuff here. These css files were generated using pygmentize\r\non the command line like so::\r\n\r\n    pygmentize -S default -f html > default.css\r\n\r\nI'm using a combination of Pygments and Markdown on a django project that has a model with the following save method::\r\n\r\n    def save(self):\r\n        self.html = markdown(self.body, 'codehilite')\r\n        super(Entry, self).save()\r\n\r\nThat's why the CSS styles all have .codehilite in front of them. You should change the .codehilite to work with the style name that you use for your Pygments HTML output.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
