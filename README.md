# highlight-css

This repository hosts CSS files for Pygments-compatible styles.

Primarily these are the styles built into [Pygments](http://pygments.org), with a few more from [Rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge) (which is used by [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)).

build
-----

```
pip install pygments
gem install rouge
make
```

New styles in Pygments and/or Rouge will be automatically detected by the [makefile](https://github.com/numist/highlight-css/blob/main/makefile).
